### Future Diffusion

This is the fine-tuned Stable Diffusion 2.0 model trained on high quality 3D images with a futuristic Sci-Fi theme.
Use the tokens   
`future style`   
 in your prompts for the effect.
Trained on Stability.ai's  [Stable Diffusion 2.0 Base](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-base) with 512x512 resolution.
